## üìå Overview
This model classifies audio segments into three categories:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Noise only**  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Single-speaker activity**  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Concurrent-speaker activity**  

The method was evaluated on **AMI, AliMeeting, and CHiME-5** datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art results.  


## Model Architecture - High Level
The high-level architecture of our proposed model is presented in the following figure.<br/>
It consists of three main blocks: Embedding, Transformer, and Classification.<br/>
1Ô∏è‚É£ The Embedding block linearly projects the input data and generates the input tokens for the Transformer model.<br/>
1Ô∏è‚É£ The Transformer block captures complex relations within its input data.<br/>
1Ô∏è‚É£ The Classification block maps the learned features to the final output predictions.<br/>

## Model Architecture - Single-Channel Embedding Block
The single-channel embedding block transforms the input data into tokens used by the Transformer block. <br/>
The input log spectrum is split into patches with a 2-D learnable kernel with a stride set to 1. <br/>
Our analysis shows a useful patch size of 257 x 8, as it jointly analyzes the entire frequency axis.
Each patch is then linearly projected to a dimension of 768, resulting in a tensor of shape #Patches x 768.
