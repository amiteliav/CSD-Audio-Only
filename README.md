### Concurrent Speaker Detection: A Multi-Microphone Transformer-Based Approach

This repository contains the code for the **audio-only model** presented in the paper:  
📄 **"Concurrent Speaker Detection: A Multi-Microphone Transformer-Based Approach"**  
🔗 [Link to Paper (if available)]([#](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10715386))  

## 📌 Overview
This model classifies audio segments into three categories:
1️⃣ **Noise only**  
2️⃣ **Single-speaker activity**  
3️⃣ **Concurrent-speaker activity**  

We use a **Transformer-based model** adapted for **multi-microphone** audio input.
