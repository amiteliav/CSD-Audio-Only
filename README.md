### Concurrent Speaker Detection: A Multi-Microphone Transformer-Based Approach

This repository contains the code for the **audio-only model** presented in the paper:  
📄 **"Concurrent Speaker Detection: A Multi-Microphone Transformer-Based Approach"**  
🔗 [Link to Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10715386)  

## 📌 Overview
This model classifies audio segments into three categories:

1️⃣ **Noise only**  
2️⃣ **Single-speaker activity**  
3️⃣ **Concurrent-speaker activity**  

The method was evaluated on **AMI, AliMeeting, and CHiME-5** datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art results.
